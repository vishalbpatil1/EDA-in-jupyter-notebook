Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is used to explore different aspects of the data we are working on. EDA should be performed in order to find the patterns, visual insights, etc.
that the data set is having, before creating a model or predicting something through the dataset. EDA is a general approach of identifying characteristics of the data we are working on by visualizing the dataset. EDA is performed to visualize what data is telling us before implementing any formal modelling or creating a hypothesis testing model.

Analyzing a dataset is a hectic task and takes a lot of time, according to a study EDA takes around 30% effort of the project but it cannot be eliminated. Python provides certain open-source modules that can automate the whole process of EDA and save a lot of time. Some of these popular modules that we are going to explore here.
